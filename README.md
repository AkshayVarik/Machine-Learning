# Machine-Learning
This repository is part of my coursework CIS 520 on Machine Learning, a graduate level course at University of Pennsylvania.

Developed a system for predicting someoneâ€™s gender (male/female) from the language of their tweets and the image they post with their
twitter profile. Training set of 5000 labeled samples were provided to be tested on 5000 testing samples. Wrote ensembled algorithm on
MATLAB to obtain an efficiency of 90.79%.

Note: The folder contain codes while the project was in its development stage and hence some of them may not be in entirity or well 
defined as some things were being done to quickly try out certain things and in quest to improve pur efficiency.
